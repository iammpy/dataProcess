Using the matrix, a computer can find all solutions relatively quickly, for example, using Dancing Links. \"\"Main articles: Sudoku, Sudoku solving algorithms\"\" The problem in Sudoku is to assign numbers (or digits, values, symbols) to cells (or squares) in a grid so as to satisfy certain constraints. In the standard 9×9 Sudoku variant, there are four kinds of constraints: While the first constraint might seem trivial, it is nevertheless needed to ensure there is only one number per cell. Intuitively, placing a number into a cell prohibits placing that number in any other cell sharing the same column,\n",

Population-level views of cells can offer a distorted view of the data by averaging out the properties of distinct subsets of cells. For example, if half the cells of a particular group are expressing high levels of a given gene, and the rest are expressing low levels, results from a population-wide analysis may appear as if all cells are expressing a medium level of the given gene. Thus, single-cell analysis allows researchers to study biological processes in finer detail and answer questions\n",

In 2007, scientists at the University of Nevada School of Medicine created a sheep whose blood contained 15% human cells and 85% sheep cells.

In so doing, he coined the word \"\"epigenetic\"\" to represent the ordered differentiation of embryonic cells into functionally distinct cell types despite having identical primary structure of their DNA. Waddington’s epigenetics was sporadically discussed, becoming more of a catch-all for puzzling non-genetic heritable characters rather than advancing the body of inquiry. Consequently, the definition of Waddington’s word has itself evolved, broadening beyond the subset of developmentally signaled, inherited cell specialization. Some scientists have questioned if epigenetic inheritance compromises the foundation of the modern synthesis.
